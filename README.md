## 2022

**Humankind - A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman:** This book covers several aspects of sociology, philosophy and psycology in a way to makes more hopeful with human nature. It's a very interesting read with many real life stories.

**A Little History of Philosophy (Nigel Warburton):** I actually started reading this many years ago, but ended up forgetting about it ðŸ˜… So this year after reading Humankind (mentioned above) I felt it was a good time to finish it and get more context of what I had just read. The book covers briefly many philosophers and schools of thought, so if you like one, you can dive into.

**Napoleon's Buttons (Penny le Couteur):** This is a book about how chemistry and certain molecules changed the course of history. I don't know much about chemistry, but I found the stories very interesting and I could even understand some of the more detailed chemistry stuff.

**The Alienist (Machado de Assis)**: Must read, one of the classics by a Brazilian author, written in the nineteenth century, it discusses the psycology of insanity with a very ironic taste and beautiful language.

**Fluent Python (Luciano Ramalho)**: I also started this one over a year ago, but have just finished it in the beginning of the year. Must read for any python developers seeking to improve from the basics to intermediate and advanced.

**Menino do Mato (Manoel de Barros)**: One of the last books by Manoel de Barros, a Brazilian author, this book delivers the style of the author in a very mature and refined way. The story is inspired by the childhood of the author and he tries to capture the world through the eyes of this boy, who seeks to understand and explain the world. Beautiful book!

**The Stoic Challenge: A Philosopher's Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient (William Irvine)**: Great book on Stoicism, combining a 2 thousand year old philosophy with the modern findings in psycology. Curiously, I think Stoicism has a lot to do with [Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/books/) (by Google), specially in the way they recommend we deal with incidents.


## 2021
**The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts (Shane Parrish):** Excellent book about using multidisciplinary thinking concepts to solve real world problems. 

**To kill a mockingbird (Harper Lee)**: A north american classic, the story is beautiful and yet heartbreaking. It takes place in the south of the United States in the beginning of the nineteenth century, discussing several aspects of rascism and social structures.

**Start with Why (Simon Sinek)**: An inspiring book about innovation, motivation and purpose. It also combines some aspects of human biology/nature and explain how that plays out in our relationships. It also contains many interesting stories on how Apple and other companies "started with why" and were able to innovate in their fields.

## 2020

**Frankestein (Mary Shelley):** One of my favorite books of all time, written by Mary Shelley in her teens. It is an extremely beautiful and pleasant reading. About the story, I would not say the main point is about creating a monster. For me, the main thing about this book is that is delivers a rich story about abandon, solitude, justice and social responsibility. 

**Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less (Greg McKeown)**: Life is short and our time and energy are extremelly limited. This book helped me see and define what's most important in my life and focus on those things ;)

**The old man and the sea (Ernest Hemingway)**: Inspiring book about patience and resilience. Extremelly well written and beautiful to read.

**O dilema do porco-espinho: Como encarar a solidÃ£o (Leandro Karnal)**: This one hasn't been translated to english yet, but it is from a contemporary brazilian philosopher. The book talks about lonileness and solitude, giving many examples of how solitude is represented in the arts (movies, books, paintings).

**The shinning (Stephen King):** One of the classics from Stephen King. It has some differences from the movie (adapted by Stanley Kubrick), but it's worth the read if you fancy some horror stories.


## 2019 and before

**The Power of Habit (Charles Duhigg):** Great book to understand how we create our habits. For me, having such understanding is essential to build new habits and remove unwanted ones. Of course, I'm still a human, so I don't try to be perfect at getting those habits right and I'll have many failures. But even when I doesn't work as I expect, I can understand why it didn't work and adjust accordingly.

**Site Reliability Engineering (Many authors at Google):** The book explains how Google manages their production systems, including explanations on how to manage incidents and outages, metrics, error budgets and a lot more.
