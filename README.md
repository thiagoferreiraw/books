## 2022

**Humankind - A Hopeful History by Rutger Bregman:** This book covers several aspects of sociology, philosophy and psycology in a way to makes more hopeful with human nature. It's a very interesting read with many real life stories.

**A Little History of Philosophy (Nigel Warburton):** I actually started reading this many years ago, but ended up forgetting about it ðŸ˜… So this year after reading Humankind (mentioned above) I felt it was a good time to finish it and get more context of what I had just read. The book covers briefly many philosophers and schools of thought, so if you like one, you can dive into.

**Napoleon's Buttons (Penny le Couteur):** This is a book about how chemistry and certain molecules changed the course of history. I don't know much about chemistry, but I found the stories very interesting and I could even understand some of the more detailed chemistry stuff.

**The Alienist (Machado de Assis)**: Must read, one of the classics by a Brazilian author, written in the nineteenth century, it discusses the psycology of insanity with a very ironic taste and beautiful language.

**Fluent Python (Luciano Ramalho)**: I also started this one over a year ago, but have just finished it in the beginning of the year. Must read for any python developers seeking to improve from the basics to intermediate and advanced.

## 2021
**The Great Mental Models Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts (Shane Parrish):** Excellent book about using multidisciplinary thinking concepts to solve real world problems. 

**To kill a mockingbird (Harper Lee)**: A north american classic, the story is beautiful and yet heartbreaking. It takes place in the south of the United States in the beginning of the nineteenth century, discussing several aspects of rascism and social structures.

## 2020

**Frankestein (Mary Shelley):** One of my favorite books of all time, written by Mary Shelley in her teens. It is an extremely beautiful and pleasant reading. About the story, I would not say the main point is about creating a monster. For me, the main thing about this book is that is delivers a rich story about abandon, solitude, justice and social responsibility. 

**Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less (Greg McKeown)**: Life is short and our time and energy are extremelly limited. This book helped me see and define what's most important in my life and focus on those things ;)

**The old man and the sea (Ernest Hemingway)**: Inspiring book about patience and resilience. Extremelly well written and beautiful to read.

**O dilema do porco-espinho: Como encarar a solidÃ£o (Leandro Karnal)**: This one hasn't been translated to english yet, but it is from a contemporary brazilian philosopher. The book talks about lonileness and solitude, giving many examples of how solitude is represented in the arts (movies, books, paintings).

**The shinning (Stephen King):** One of the classics from Stephen King. It has some differences from the movie (adapted by Stanley Kubrick), but it's worth the read if you fancy some horror stories.


## 2019 and before

**The Power of Habit (Charles Duhigg):** Great book to understand how we create our habits. For me, having such understanding is essential to build new habits and remove unwanted ones. Of course, I'm still a human, so I don't try to be perfect at getting those habits right and I'll have many failures. But even when I doesn't work as I expect, I can understand why it didn't work and adjust accordingly.
